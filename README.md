* Students must be able to draw and interpret diagrams of collaborative Git branching workflows.
* Students must be able to create new branches with Git.
* Students must be able to push local branches to GitHub.

* Students must be able to pull upstream changes from GitHub.
* Students must be able to pull from the appropriate branch(es) on GitHub.
* Students must be able to merge their branches into their local`master` on the command line.

* Students must be able to resolve merge conflicts on their computers.
* Students must be able to request integration of their changes via PR.

Presentation Requirements
The presentation requirements for Project 1 are as follows.
Your presentation must:
 
* Be at least 8-10 min. long
* Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
* Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them
* Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
* Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
* Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
* Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as  visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)
* Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".
* Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.

Technical Requirements
* The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.
* Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
* Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process
* Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
* Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
* Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
* Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
